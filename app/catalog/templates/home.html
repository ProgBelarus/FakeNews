                Hello! You will be shortly asked to complete the fake news survey. Before doing so,
                please familiarize yourself with the instructions given below. On completing the form,
                you will receive further instructions on how to provide evidence of form completion in
                your Amazon Mechanical Turk response.

                  <div class="panel-body">
                      Fake news is about making people believe false facts. For example, []
                            tries to make people believe that [], which is not true [link]. A
                            sentence you might highlight as an example of a false report is: []

                      An item may be heavily biased, but not be fake news. If the point of
                            the item is to convince the reader of an opinion, but not to convince
                            the reader that something happened that didn't actually happen, the
                            item is not fake news. For example [] is not fake news despite being
                            heavily biased.

                      A heavily biased item that would lead the reader to believe false
                            facts is fake news. For example,
                              <a href="https://infostormer.com/jew-chuck-schumer-threatens-to-kill-supreme-court-justices/">this article</a>
                              is fake news because the headline is false. However, if the full quote of what Schumer said were included, as it
                            is in <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/03/06/threatening_supreme_court_justices_is_never_ok_142586.html">this article</a>,
                              the item would be not fake news.

                      A subtype of heavily biased items is items engaging in conspiratorial
                            thinking. For example,
                            <a href="https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2020/02/24/overhyped-coronavirus-weaponized-against-trump/">this article</a>
                            suggests that the Coronavirus originated in a lab in China. Although
                            this is widely believed to be a false claim, any reader would
                            understand this as a conjecture, rather than a report of known facts
