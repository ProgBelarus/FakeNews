Nolte: Scientists Prove Man-Made Global Warming Is a Hoax

################ Subtitle:

The far-left ThinkProgress reports that scientists have finally proven that the theory of man-made Global Warming is a total hoax.

################ Text:

<p>
The far-left ThinkProgress reports that scientists have finally proven that the theory of man-made Global Warming is a total hoax.
</p>
<p>
Of course, no one will admit it, but that is exactly what has happened.
</p>
<p>
A new scientific study shows has revealed the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Current CO2 levels of 410 parts per million (ppm) were last seen on Earth three million years ago, according to the most detailed reconstruction of the Earth’s climate by researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and published in Science Advances.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes, you read that correctly, three million — million — years ago CO2 levels on Earth were the same as they are today, but there is one major difference between three million years ago and today…
</p>
<p>
Three million years ago, we humans were not driving cars or eating the meat that requires cow farts; we weren’t barbecuing or refusing to recycle or building factories; there was no Industrial Age, no plastic, no air conditioning, no electricity, no lumber mills, no consumerism, no aerosols.
</p>
<p>
In fact, three million years ago, there were probably no human beings on Earth, at least not human in the way we use that term today. And yet…
</p>
<p>
CO2 levels were the same then as they are now…
</p>
<p>
Hmmm…?
</p>
<p>
But I thought humans warmed the planet? That’s the hustle we’ve been sold for three decades now — you know, that WE are the problem.
</p>
<p>
We have also been told the problem is DEFINITELY NOT a billions-year-old planet running through cycles where the temperature might fluctuate a bit. Oh, no, that could never be it — so stop saying that could be, you Denier.
</p>
<p>
Well, what about the Ice Age that occurred thousands and thousands of years before the Industrial Age.
</p>
<p>
Shut up, Denier.
</p>
<p>
And yet…
</p>
<p>
According to the study, scientists also discovered that during this period of Global Warming “there were no ice sheets covering either Greenland or West Antarctica, and much of the East Antarctic ice sheet was gone.”
</p>
<p>
How is this possible 2,999,971 years before Arnold Schwarzenegger bought his Hummer?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It gets worse:
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Temperatures were up to 7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer globally, at least double that at the poles, and sea levels were some 20 meters (65 feet) higher.
</p>
<p>
How is that possible 2,999,945 years before Americans moved to the suburbs and lit up the charcoal grills?
</p>
<p>
Naturally, even in the face of a study that totally debunks the whole concept of man-made Global Warming, ThinkProgress is sticking with that hoax but is also forced to concede the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The good news is that the Earth does not warm instantly, and mile-thick ice sheets melt even more slowly. So the temperature rise will take several decades, and tens of feet of sea level rise will take hundreds and hundreds of years.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
But-but-but-but Alexandria Ocasio-Crazy told me we only have 12 years!
</p>
<p>
And then ThinkProgress drops this anti-science stink bomb:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
That means the choices we make now can affect the rate of rise and determine whether we blow past 65 feet of sea level rise to beyond 200 feet.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Because, because, because Orange Man Bad:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Even worse, the climate policy agenda President Donald Trump is pushing — actions that include rolling back U.S. laws that reduce carbon pollution and abandoning the Paris climate agreement — would lock us in to such high CO2 levels, sea levels would rise a foot per decade in just a few decades.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
No, actually, what this study proves is that there is nothing we can do to stop  the Earth’s naturally occurring climate cycles. Even the worst of the worst, even the most maniacal pushing the Global Warming Hoax admit that, at best, we can only cool the planet a couple of degrees, which will do next to nothing if the planet is determined to again warm itself by seven degrees, as we now know it did 2,999,998 years before the Bad Orange Man approved a couple of pipelines.

Nostradamus 'predicted killer virus outbreak in chilling prophecy' as Coronavirus spreads

################ Subtitle:

The mysterious French prophet wrote about a "great plague" in one extract that has been seized upon by a conspiracy theorist

################ Text:

<p>
Nostradamus supposedly predicted an outbreak of SARS in a disturbing prophecy – as fears of the Coronavirus spread.
</p>
<p>
The mysterious French prophet is interpreted as having predicted the rise of Napoleon and Hitler, along with the 9/11 attacks.
</p>
<p>
He died in 1566 and his books have been studied for centuries since.
</p>
<p>
One passage from his writings reads: “The great plague of the maritime city will not cease until there be avenged the death of the just blood, condemned for a price without crime, of the great lady outraged by pretense.”
</p>
<p>
A conspiracy theorist has latched on to the extract, tying it to fears of a SARS-like virus spreading.
</p>
<p>
They write: “The start of SARS and preponderance of cases are in China, many of which are in Hong Kong. Therefore it is reasonable to view Hong Kong as ‘the maritime city’.”
</p>
<p>
They also claim the “great lady” mentioned could be former Chinese Health Minister Wu Yi, who was previously appointed to help contain the SARS virus.
</p>
<p>
The killer Chinese coronavirus that is sweeping across Asia may already be in Britain, health experts have warned.
</p>
<p>
Heathrow Airport announced it will separate al passengers flying into the UK from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the heart of the outbreak.
</p>
<p>
Scientists have also warned up to 10,000 patients may have caught the SARS-like virus in Wuhan – more than double the previous estimate.
</p>
<p>
483 people have so far been diagnosed and the disease has reached the US.
</p>
<p>
A man in his 30s from Washington State was confirmed to be the first American case after travelling back from Wuhan.
</p>
<p>
The death toll this morning rose to nine.
</p>
<p>
Top officials from the World Health Organisation today convened for an emergency meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, where they are expected to confirm the outbreak poses a “public health emergency”.
</p>
<p>
Respiratory symptoms include a fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties.
</p>
<p>
In more severe cases, it can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory symptoms, and kidney failure.

Russian President, Vladimir Putin Releases 800 Tigers And 500 Lions To Enforce ‘No Gathering’ Rule In The Country

################ Subtitle:

################ Text:

The president of Russia, Vladimir Putin has reportedly released 500 lions and 800 tigers onto the streets of Russia to enforce the total lockdown rule in the country.

This came to light just a few hours he sent a very short statement to all Russians on the prevention of the Coronavirus which reads;

”Stay at home for 15 days or go to jail for 5 years”

Yesterday, 21st of March, 2020, Rospotrebnadzor, Russia’s state consumer watchdog, said that it had run more than 156,000 coronavirus tests in total with 253 people infected.

In a related development, Putin has also entrusted the minister in charge of trade to revoke the license of any business outfit that tries to profit off the pandemic by selling products at exorbitant prices.

CEO Assures Employees He Doing Everything In His Power To Lay People Off

################ Subtitle:

################ Text:

SAN FRANCISCO—Promising from the bottom of his heart that everyone’s jobs are in jeopardy,
WhooshSnaps.biz CEO Brian Kleppen assured employees Thursday that he’s doing everything in his power
to lay people off. “I’ve heard some concerns going around, and I want to impress upon each and every one of
you that I’m taking every possible step to ensure that you are all out of a job with no income or health insurance,”
said Kleppen in a company-wide email to employees, explaining that he was exploring all avenues to over leverage
investments, misappropriate funds, and implement new approaches to hemorrhage money with the goal of firing as many
staffers as possible. “Believe me when I say if it were up to me, I would terminate every single one of you. It gives
me no pleasure to keep you around. The absolute last thing we want to do is retain all of our staff during
this crisis.” At press time, Kleppen was working around the clock to free up funds tied up in employee paychecks to
secure his year-end bonus.

As Covid-19 relief program runs out of money, Democrats blame ‘KILLING’ of small businesses on Mnuchin – and fill up on ice cream

################ Subtitle:

################ Text:

<p>
The Paycheck Protection Program intended to help small businesses bridge coronavirus lockdowns has run out of funds. Democrats, who opposed extending it, are now misquoting Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to blame him instead.
All $350 billion in the PPP was exhausted by Thursday, as over 1.6 million small businesses sought funds to keep running through the coronavirus lockdowns. Some 22 million Americans have already lost their jobs due to what senior public health officials described as an “inconvenience” that has lasted over a month already.
</p>
<p>
Both President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) placed the blame squarely on the Democrats, who last week refused to vote for a “clean” bill that would add funding to the PPP. Trump urged the opposition party to “stop playing politics” and accused it of “killing American small businesses.”
</p>
<p>
The PPP was part of a $2 trillion stimulus package intended to help the economy through what was initially supposed to be a two-week shutdown to stop the spread of the virus – which has since turned into a month, with some states wishing to extend it indefinitely. The relief was arguably already too little, too late by the time it was passed, having been delayed by over a week due to demands from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California).
</p>
<p>
In order to get it passed as quickly as possible, the White House basically sidelined the congressional Republicans and delegated Mnuchin to negotiate directly with Pelosi, agreeing to some notorious pork-barrel projects such as $25 million for the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC – which ended up firing their staff anyway.
</p>
<p>
So it is doubly ironic that Mnuchin found himself the designated villain on Thursday, as Democrat activists accused him of saying that Americans are supposed to make the $1,200 cash payment from the government stretch for 10 weeks.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Brianna Westbrook
✔
@BWestbrookAZ8
</p>
<p>
Steve Mnuchin thinks Americans can live on $1,200 for 10 weeks.
</p>
<p>
Embedded video
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Arizona Democrat Brianna Westbrook’s video of Mnuchin’s CBS appearance went viral. Within hours, Mnuchin’s name was being cursed by a chorus ranging from #Resistance activists and earnest Bernie Sanders followers, to mainstream media journalists and disgraced former members of Congress.
</p>
<p>
The trouble with it is that Mnuchin was not speaking about the $1,200 checks. His full quote, which sites like Raw Story dutifully cited – and then used a misleading clickbait headline to misinterpret it – literally refers to the entire $2 trillion CARES Act:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I think the entire package provides economic relief overall for about 10 weeks.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The noise about the Treasury secretary conveniently drowned out any mention of Pelosi herself, who did her best Marie Antoinette impression by posting a video about enjoying a walk-in freezer filled with ice cream.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Nancy Pelosi
✔
@SpeakerPelosi
</p>
<p>
We all have found our ways to keep our spirits up during these trying times. Mine just happens to fill up my freezer. #LateLateShow
</p>
<p>
Embedded video
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
While the US healthcare system has not been overwhelmed by Covid-19 patients and the alarmist models used to justify the lockdowns were off by orders of magnitude, the virus has infected over 641,000 Americans and killed 31,590, according to official data as of Thursday.
