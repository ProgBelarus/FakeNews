Nolte: Scientists Prove Man-Made Global Warming Is a Hoax

################ Subtitle:

The far-left ThinkProgress reports that scientists have finally proven that the theory of man-made Global Warming is a total hoax.

################ Text:

<p>
The far-left ThinkProgress reports that scientists have finally proven that the theory of man-made Global Warming is a total hoax.
</p>
<p>
Of course, no one will admit it, but that is exactly what has happened.
</p>
<p>
A new scientific study shows has revealed the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Current CO2 levels of 410 parts per million (ppm) were last seen on Earth three million years ago, according to the most detailed reconstruction of the Earth’s climate by researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and published in Science Advances.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes, you read that correctly, three million — million — years ago CO2 levels on Earth were the same as they are today, but there is one major difference between three million years ago and today…
</p>
<p>
Three million years ago, we humans were not driving cars or eating the meat that requires cow farts; we weren’t barbecuing or refusing to recycle or building factories; there was no Industrial Age, no plastic, no air conditioning, no electricity, no lumber mills, no consumerism, no aerosols.
</p>
<p>
In fact, three million years ago, there were probably no human beings on Earth, at least not human in the way we use that term today. And yet…
</p>
<p>
CO2 levels were the same then as they are now…
</p>
<p>
Hmmm…?
</p>
<p>
But I thought humans warmed the planet? That’s the hustle we’ve been sold for three decades now — you know, that WE are the problem.
</p>
<p>
We have also been told the problem is DEFINITELY NOT a billions-year-old planet running through cycles where the temperature might fluctuate a bit. Oh, no, that could never be it — so stop saying that could be, you Denier.
</p>
<p>
Well, what about the Ice Age that occurred thousands and thousands of years before the Industrial Age.
</p>
<p>
Shut up, Denier.
</p>
<p>
And yet…
</p>
<p>
According to the study, scientists also discovered that during this period of Global Warming “there were no ice sheets covering either Greenland or West Antarctica, and much of the East Antarctic ice sheet was gone.”
</p>
<p>
How is this possible 2,999,971 years before Arnold Schwarzenegger bought his Hummer?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It gets worse:
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Temperatures were up to 7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer globally, at least double that at the poles, and sea levels were some 20 meters (65 feet) higher.
</p>
<p>
How is that possible 2,999,945 years before Americans moved to the suburbs and lit up the charcoal grills?
</p>
<p>
Naturally, even in the face of a study that totally debunks the whole concept of man-made Global Warming, ThinkProgress is sticking with that hoax but is also forced to concede the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The good news is that the Earth does not warm instantly, and mile-thick ice sheets melt even more slowly. So the temperature rise will take several decades, and tens of feet of sea level rise will take hundreds and hundreds of years.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
But-but-but-but Alexandria Ocasio-Crazy told me we only have 12 years!
</p>
<p>
And then ThinkProgress drops this anti-science stink bomb:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
That means the choices we make now can affect the rate of rise and determine whether we blow past 65 feet of sea level rise to beyond 200 feet.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Because, because, because Orange Man Bad:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Even worse, the climate policy agenda President Donald Trump is pushing — actions that include rolling back U.S. laws that reduce carbon pollution and abandoning the Paris climate agreement — would lock us in to such high CO2 levels, sea levels would rise a foot per decade in just a few decades.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
No, actually, what this study proves is that there is nothing we can do to stop  the Earth’s naturally occurring climate cycles. Even the worst of the worst, even the most maniacal pushing the Global Warming Hoax admit that, at best, we can only cool the planet a couple of degrees, which will do next to nothing if the planet is determined to again warm itself by seven degrees, as we now know it did 2,999,998 years before the Bad Orange Man approved a couple of pipelines.

Nostradamus 'predicted killer virus outbreak in chilling prophecy' as Coronavirus spreads

################ Subtitle:

The mysterious French prophet wrote about a "great plague" in one extract that has been seized upon by a conspiracy theorist

################ Text:

<p>
Nostradamus supposedly predicted an outbreak of SARS in a disturbing prophecy – as fears of the Coronavirus spread.
</p>
<p>
The mysterious French prophet is interpreted as having predicted the rise of Napoleon and Hitler, along with the 9/11 attacks.
</p>
<p>
He died in 1566 and his books have been studied for centuries since.
</p>
<p>
One passage from his writings reads: “The great plague of the maritime city will not cease until there be avenged the death of the just blood, condemned for a price without crime, of the great lady outraged by pretense.”
</p>
<p>
A conspiracy theorist has latched on to the extract, tying it to fears of a SARS-like virus spreading.
</p>
<p>
They write: “The start of SARS and preponderance of cases are in China, many of which are in Hong Kong. Therefore it is reasonable to view Hong Kong as ‘the maritime city’.”
</p>
<p>
They also claim the “great lady” mentioned could be former Chinese Health Minister Wu Yi, who was previously appointed to help contain the SARS virus.
</p>
<p>
The killer Chinese coronavirus that is sweeping across Asia may already be in Britain, health experts have warned.
</p>
<p>
Heathrow Airport announced it will separate al passengers flying into the UK from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the heart of the outbreak.
</p>
<p>
Scientists have also warned up to 10,000 patients may have caught the SARS-like virus in Wuhan – more than double the previous estimate.
</p>
<p>
483 people have so far been diagnosed and the disease has reached the US.
</p>
<p>
A man in his 30s from Washington State was confirmed to be the first American case after travelling back from Wuhan.
</p>
<p>
The death toll this morning rose to nine.
</p>
<p>
Top officials from the World Health Organisation today convened for an emergency meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, where they are expected to confirm the outbreak poses a “public health emergency”.
</p>
<p>
Respiratory symptoms include a fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties.
</p>
<p>
In more severe cases, it can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory symptoms, and kidney failure.

Russian President, Vladimir Putin Releases 800 Tigers And 500 Lions To Enforce ‘No Gathering’ Rule In The Country

################ Subtitle:

################ Text:

The president of Russia, Vladimir Putin has reportedly released 500 lions and 800 tigers onto the streets of Russia to enforce the total lockdown rule in the country.

This came to light just a few hours he sent a very short statement to all Russians on the prevention of the Coronavirus which reads;

”Stay at home for 15 days or go to jail for 5 years”

Yesterday, 21st of March, 2020, Rospotrebnadzor, Russia’s state consumer watchdog, said that it had run more than 156,000 coronavirus tests in total with 253 people infected.

In a related development, Putin has also entrusted the minister in charge of trade to revoke the license of any business outfit that tries to profit off the pandemic by selling products at exorbitant prices.

Coronavirus: COVID-19 vaccines kill seven children in Senegal immediately after given shots

################ Subtitle:

################ Text:

<p>
So it begins. We covered the two white imperial doctors fetishizing their demented desire to use African children as guinea pigs for vaccines. The director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) strongly condemned the comments, saying this would not happen. But apparently he isn’t as powerful as he believes.
</p>
<p>
Seven children died this week after being given experimental vaccines in Senegal, according to a report by the website ezone57.com. The website appears to be Ghana-based. The story has since been removed from the site and, somehow, removed from web archives as well.
</p>
<p>
The people in charge of the vaccine program were reportedly arrested by the Gendarmerie (State Police) or one of the ten regional police forces.  No other information is available. We attempted calling the phone number on the Gendamerie website, but got no answer as of publishing. There doesn’t appear to be a way to contact Senegal police via email.
</p>
<p>
UPDATE April 14, 2020: Kizzmekia Corbett: Wikipedia, Twitter fast-track black vaccine researcher to relevance (April 14, 2020)
</p>
<p>
Youtube removes independent video confirming vaccine deaths
</p>
<p>
A video originally uploaded to Youtube lends more credence to the story. A user named Aggie’s Fam posted a 13-minute video on April 6. She appears to be from Nigeria. The video confirmed the story of seven kids being killed. But she described them as “infants.” This paraphrased quote starts at about the 1:50 mark.
</p>
<p>
“I really don’t know what’s wrong with our African leaders. Today, a nurse told my husband that seven infants have died in Senegal due to this coronavirus vaccine. I just don’t get it, why you must collect this thing when you know that it’s not being tested? You want to use your people as guinea pigs. Lab rats? Because of what? Do they give you money to kill? If you kill all your people in your land, who will remain for you govern? You will end up going to the ground like you end up falling like zero level. What is your problem? Oh my god, this is stupid.”
</p>
<p>
We quickly downloaded the video knowing Youtube would likely remove it. Sure enough, the video was removed minutes after we got a copy and re-uploaded it to Vimeo.
UPDATE April 13, 2020 – Vimeo has now removed the video as well, and our entire channel. We have re-uploaded to Bitchute.
We only had 3-4 videos on there anyway. Now they keep sending us emails like we give a damn to “appeal” to their minor league platform. Here is the email we got from Vimeo:
</p>
<p>
Reason: You cannot upload videos that depict or encourage self-harm, falsely claim that mass tragedies are hoaxes, or perpetuate false or misleading claims about vaccine safety.
</p>
<p>
Aggie’s video had over 42,000 views before removal, by far the most views of any video on her channel. We also took a screenshot of her channel. It’s not out of the question for Youtube to remove her altogether.
</p>
<p>
UPDATE 1:45 p.m. Pacific – We contacted the woman who posted the video. She said she never expected it to get the attention it has. She appealed the deletion of her video to Youtube to no avail. Aggie said she has mixed feelings about the video now that it has gone viral. But she also wants the truth to be known. “I am scared. Because it’s too much for me and my husband, he don’t want that,” she said.
</p>
<p>
These incidents are likely to pick up steam across the Continent. Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo announced that the country received $100 million from the World Bank last month. The funds are for “fighting coronavirus.” One of the apparent strings attached is allowing Bill Gates and his imperial doctors to experiment on children in the country.
</p>
<p>
Other African nations are resisting imperial medicine. Protestors in the Ivory Coast destroyed a coronavirus testing center this past Sunday. They believed the facility housed coronavirus patients. They did not want the diseases spreading through the city of Abidjan. Police used tear gas to disburse the crowd. But the damage was already done to the facility. Abidjan has been locked down since March 23. Ivory Coast has only 323 confirmed cases of coronavirus.
</p>
<p>
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. slams Bill Gates
</p>
<p>
It’s no wonder the Euro-Zionist empire hates the Kennedy family so much. They killed President John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert F. Kennedy. Maeve Kennedy Townsend McKean was found dead in Charles County, Maryland this week after an alleged canoeing accident. Her 8-year-old son Gideon McKean is still missing. Maeve McKean is the daughter of former Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend. She is one of RFK’s 11 children. Now RFK, Jr. needs to be careful.
</p>
<p>
RFK, Jr. posted a lengthy story on Instagram a couple days ago. Bill Gates is obsessed with vaccines due to a “messianic conviction that he is ordained to save the world with technology and a god-like willingness to experiment with the lives of lesser humans,” said RFK, Jr. Gates essentially purchased India’s National Advisory Board (NAB) for $1.2 billion in 2000. His first mandate was giving all Indian children 50 polio vaccines each. The vaccines caused paralysis in 496,000 children from 2000-2017, according to RFK, Jr.
</p>
<p>
“The Gates Foundation funded a trial of a [GlaxoSmithKline] experimental malaria vaccine, killing 151 African infants and causing serious adverse effects including paralysis, seizure, and febrile convulsions to 1,048 of the 5,049 children,” RFK, Jr. wrote. He didn’t stop there.
</p>
<p>
In 2017, the World Health Organization reluctantly admitted that the global polio explosion is predominantly vaccine strain, meaning it is coming from Gates’ Vaccine Program. The most frightening epidemics in Congo, the Philippines, and Afghanistan are all linked to Gates’ vaccines. By 2018, ¾ of global polio cases were from Gates’ vaccines. A 2017 study (Morgensen et.Al.2017) showed that WHO’s popular DTP is killing more African than the disease it pretends to prevent. Vaccinated girls suffered 10x the death rate of unvaccinated children. Gates and the WHO refused to recall the lethal vaccine which WHO forces upon millions of African children annually.
</p>
<p>
Gates has given at least $10 billion to the WHO since 2010. He’s the largest donor to the organization other than the U.S. government. Gates essentially owns the WHO and calls all the shots (no pun intended).
</p>
<p>
*UPDATE 3:45 a.m. Pacific: Agence France-Presse (AFP) writer Anne-Sophie Faivre Le Cadre says in a “fact check” story that Senegalese children “did not die.” The story was published shortly after our story went live. It talks about some video on Facebook that has nothing to do with our story.
The AFP reporter cited an unnamed spokeswoman for Senegal’s health ministry as a source. The reporter says no vaccine exists, despite patent documents being readily-available online. This declaration, and the anonymous spokeswoman, further discredit the French media response. A French-speaking Senegalese spokeswoman using the term “fake news” is also suspect.
Mainstream media are strictly on code right now, controlling the entire COVID-19 and 5G narratives. It’s up to readers to think critically. We firmly and unequivocally stand behind our story.

Obamas Buy Controlling Interest In Home Depot

################ Subtitle:

################ Text:

<p>
Being the 17th richest man in the country certainly has its advantages.  And it seems like Barack Obama and his wife have decided to make use of one.
</p>
<p>
They also get a lot of use out of the sex swing that Bernie gave them for their anniversary. Geronimo!
</p>
<p>
After hearing that the Home Depot corporation had decided to patriotically donate money to President Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign instead of bowing to back one of the socialist nincompoops currently jockeying for position, Obama and his foundation quickly hit the stock market, and gobbled up 51% of the company, establishing controlling interest.  Now, he and his wife will have the top seats of the executive board and make or approve any and all company decisions.
</p>
<p>
Home Depot is well known to be the number one place daddy goes to get away from mommy for just one goddamn hour, Jesus.
</p>
<p>
This isn’t the first time the Obama’s have used a corporate buyout strategy to quelch their enemies and critics into quivering queefmonkeys.   You probably missed it when they bought out Chic-Fil-A, Papa John’s Pizza, and Wonder Bread as well, since the liberal media kept it quiet.  But maybe with this very public feeding frenzy, it will become more obvious that Obama is building his empire, one conservative bone at a time.

SAN FRANCISCO—Promising from the bottom of his heart that everyone’s jobs are in jeopardy,
WhooshSnaps.biz CEO Brian Kleppen assured employees Thursday that he’s doing everything in his power
to lay people off. “I’ve heard some concerns going around, and I want to impress upon each and every one of
you that I’m taking every possible step to ensure that you are all out of a job with no income or health insurance,”
said Kleppen in a company-wide email to employees, explaining that he was exploring all avenues to over leverage
investments, misappropriate funds, and implement new approaches to hemorrhage money with the goal of firing as many
staffers as possible. “Believe me when I say if it were up to me, I would terminate every single one of you. It gives
me no pleasure to keep you around. The absolute last thing we want to do is retain all of our staff during
this crisis.” At press time, Kleppen was working around the clock to free up funds tied up in employee paychecks to

################ Title:

We Need Herd Immunity From Trump and the Coronavirus

################ Subtitle:

It will take more care than the president is currently demonstrating to loosen restrictions but still protect the vulnerable.

################ Text:

<p>
With each passing day it becomes more obvious how unlucky we are that one of the worst crises in American history coincides with Donald Trump’s presidency. To get out of this crisis with the least loss of life and least damage to our economy, we need a president who can steer a science-based, nonpartisan debate through the hellish ethical, economic and environmental trade-offs we have to make.
</p>
<p>
We need a president who is a cross between F.D.R., Justice Brandeis and Jonas Salk. We got a president who is a cross between Dr. Phil, Dr. Strangelove and Dr. Seuss.
</p>
<p>
Sure, Trump isn’t the only one sowing division in our society, but as president he has a megaphone like no one else, so when he spews his politics of division, and suggests disinfectants as cures, he is not only eroding our society’s physical immunity to the coronavirus but also eroding what futurist Marina Gorbis calls our “cognitive immunity” — our ability to filter out science from quackery and facts from fabrications.
</p>
<p>
As a result, the Trump daily briefing has itself become a public health hazard.
</p>
<p>
If we don’t have a president who can harmonize our need to protect ourselves from the coronavirus and our need to get back to work — as well as harmonize our need to protect the planet’s ecosystems and our need for economic growth — we are doomed.
</p>
<p>
Because this virus was actually triggered by our polarization from the natural world. And it will destroy us — physically and economically — if we stay locked in a polarized, binary argument about lives versus livelihoods.
</p>
<p>
Here is why: When you listen to Trump, one of his consistent themes is that everything was just “perfect” with our economy until — out of nowhere — this black swan, called Covid-19, showed up from China and wrecked it all. It’s true, this virus did come out of Wuhan, China, but it was anything but a black swan that no one could have expected. It was actually “a black elephant.”
</p>
<p>
The term “black elephant” was coined by environmentalist Adam Sweidan. It’s a cross between “a black swan” — an unlikely, unexpected event with enormous ramifications — and the “elephant in the room” — a looming disaster that is visible to everyone, yet no one wants to address.
</p>
<p>
Covid-19 was a black elephant. It is the logical outcome of our increasingly destructive wars against nature.
</p>
<p>
As Johan Rockström, chief scientist at Conservation International, explains: “When you simultaneously hunt for wildlife and push development into natural ecosystems — destroying natural habitats — the natural balance of species collapses due to loss of top predators and other iconic species, leading to an abundance of more generalized species adapted to live in human dominated habitats. These are rats, bats and some primates — which together host 75 percent of all known zoonotic viruses to date, and who can survive and multiply in destroyed human dominated habitats.”
</p>
<p>
As we humans have become more numerous and concentrated in cities, and as deforestation has brought these generalized species closer to us — and as countries like China, Vietnam and others in central Africa tolerated wet markets where these virus-laden species were mixed with domesticated meats — we’re seeing ever more zoonotic diseases spreading from animals to people. Their names are SARS, MERS, Ebola, bird flu, and swine flu — and Covid-19.
</p>
<p>
China, in particular, has a lot to answer for. It banned wet markets in one province after SARS in 2003, but then allowed them to reopen after SARS passed — and that apparently brought us Covid-19 out of Wuhan. (Shamefully, China reportedly still has not shut down wet markets selling wildlife.)
</p>
<p>
Add globalization to this and you have the perfect ingredients for more pandemics. We need to find a much more harmonious balance between economic growth and our ecosystems.
</p>
<p>
The same kind of harmonic approach has to be brought to our current debate about reopening the economy. One way to get there was proposed by Graham Allison, a national security expert at Harvard.
</p>
<p>
Allison wrote that we’re having this important debate about our health and economic future in an incredibly uncoordinated way. Instead, we should have federal government experts on one team offering their approach — and a Team B of independent medical, economic, public health, data and strategic analysts offering an alternative approach. And then go for the best synthesis.
</p>
<p>
For instance, Allison observed: “If we concluded that an identified group of a quarter of the population face an unacceptable risk of death from coronavirus, but that for the other 75 percent, with appropriate precautions like social distancing and masks, face no greater risk than other risks of death we accepted before coronavirus, would it be possible to design a response that protected the most vulnerable while simultaneously reopening most of the economy for others?”
</p>
<p>
As an example of Team B thinking, Graham cited the work of Dr. David Katz, a public health expert who helped kick off the debate about how to harmonize protecting the most vulnerable and opening the economy to those least at risk in an essay he wrote in The New York Times on March 20 — and in a follow-up interview we did together.
</p>
<p>
Five weeks later — and fresh off three days as a volunteer emergency room doctor in the Bronx — Katz still believes that is possible. He explained to me why, starting with what he found in the emergency ward.
</p>
<p>
“You might think that health professionals are at one extreme of opinion, concerned only about the virus and favoring locking everything down, but that was not the view I encountered,” said Katz. “The view was far more centrist: respect for the infection, but equal respect for the high cost of closing down everything — to their patients, of course, but also to themselves and their families. Many were acutely concerned about layoffs, unemployment, and real desperation affecting siblings or close friends.”
</p>
<p>
That is why, Katz insists, we have to avoid minimizing the degree to which mass unemployment, poverty, hunger and despair will devastate people if the economy remains virtually shut down. At the same time, we can’t just submit to protesters demanding their governors open everything back up indiscriminately, without data or a comprehensive health strategy,
</p>
<p>
“The moment you stop respecting this virus, it will kill someone you love,” he said.
</p>
<p>
The best strategy, argues Katz, starts with what the numbers are telling us: “More and more data are telling us that Covid-19 is two completely different diseases in different populations. It is severe and potentially lethal to the old, the chronically ill and those with pre-existing conditions. It is, however, rarely life-threatening, often mild — and often even asymptomatic — among those under 50 or 60 in generally good health.”
</p>
<p>
We still don’t yet have a perfect understanding of how the virus works — for instance, if you get it, whether you are immune from getting it again. So, we need to corroborate the patterns we’re seeing through more random sampling of the U.S. population both for infection and immunity. But if these patterns are confirmed, then the proper strategy, argued Katz, is one of “total harm minimization” that saves the most lives and health through “vertical interdiction.”
</p>
<p>
“That means sheltering the vulnerable, while allowing those who can return to the world most safely to do so — thereby restoring the economy, supply chains, and services, while cultivating the collective protection of herd immunity that leads to the ‘all clear,’” said Katz. “That’s how we get our lives back without waiting on the long and uncertain timeline of vaccine development.”
</p>
<p>
Of course, we’ll need an army of public health workers to keep doing testing and contact tracing so we can adapt to new data, limit breakouts and protect those most likely to die or be badly harmed from Covid-19.
</p>
<p>
The bottom line is that Mother Nature has been telling us something huge in this crisis: “You let everything get out of balance and go to extremes. You ravaged my ecosystems and unleashed this virus. You let political extremism ravage your body politic. You need to get back into balance, and that starts with using the immune system that I endowed you with.”
</p>
<p>
Herd immunity, which kicks in after about 60 percent of the population is exposed to and recovers from the virus, concluded Katz, “has historically been nature’s way of ending pandemics. We need to bend with her forces, while concentrating our health services and social services on protecting those most vulnerable who need to stay sheltered until there is a vaccine.”

Bill Gates will use microchip implants to fight coronavirus

################ Subtitle:

################ Text:

<p>
Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates will launch human-implantable capsules that have ‘digital certificates’ which can show who has been tested for the coronavirus and who has been vaccinated against it.
</p>
<p>
The 64 year old tech mogul and currently the second richest person in the world, revealed this yesterday during a Reddit ‘Ask Me Anything’ session while answering questions on the COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic.
</p>
<p>
Gates was responding to a question on how businesses will be able to operate while maintaining social distancing, and said that, “Eventually we will have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have a vaccine who has received it.”
</p>
<p>
The ‘digital certificates’ Gates was referring to are human-implantable ‘QUANTUM-DOT TATTOOS’ that researchers at MIT and Rice University are working on as a way to hold vaccination records. It was last year in December when scientists from the two universities revealed that they were working on these quantum-dot tattoos after Bill Gates approached them about solving the problem of identifying those who have not been vaccinated.
</p>
<p>
The quantum-dot tattoos involve applying dissolvable sugar-based microneedles that contain a vaccine and fluorescent copper-based ‘quantum dots’ embedded inside biocompatible, micron-scale capsules. After the microneedes dissolve under the skin, they leave the encapsulated quantum dots whose patterns can be read to identify the vaccine that was administered.
</p>
<p>
The quantum-dot tattoos will likely be supplemented with Bill Gates’ other undertaking called ID2020, which is an ambitious project by Microsoft to solve the problem of over 1 billion people who live without an officially recognized identity. ID2020 is solving this through digital identity. Currently, the most feasible way of implementing digital identity is either through smartphones or RFID microchip implants. The latter will be Gates’s likely approach not only because of feasibility and sustainability, but also because for over 6 years, the Gates Foundation has been funding another project that incorporates human-implantable microchip implants. This project, also spearheaded by MIT, is a birth control microchip implant that will allow women to control contraceptive hormones in their bodies.
</p>
<p>
As for ID2020, to see it through, Microsoft has formed an alliance with four other companies, namely; Accenture, IDEO, Gavi, and the Rockefeller Foundation. The project is supported by the United Nations and has been incorporated into the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals initiative.
</p>
<p>
It will be interesting to see how Bill Gates and ID2020 will execute all this because many Christians, and surprisingly a growing number of Shia Muslims, are very opposed to the idea of microchipping and any form of body-invasive identification technology. Some Christian legislators and politicians in the United States have even tried to ban all forms of human microchipping.
</p>
<p>
But, on the other hand, this is Bill Gates’ perfect opportunity to see the projects through because as the coronavirus continues to spread and more people continue to die from the pandemic, the public at large is becoming more open to problem-solving technologies that will contain the spread of the virus.
</p>
<p>
The main reason many Christians and some Shia Muslims are opposed to body-invasive identification technologies, however helpful such technologies are for preventing pandemics, is because they believe that such technologies are the so called ‘Mark of Satan’ mentioned in the Bible and some Mahdi prophecies. In the Book of Revelations in the Bible, anyone who does not have this “mark” is not allowed to buy or sell anything.
</p>
<p>
Last year in November, a Denmark-based tech company which had contracts to produce microchip implants for the Danish Government and the US Navy, had to cancel the launch of its supposedly “revolutionary” Internet-of-Things powered microchip implant after Christian activists attacked its offices in Copenhagen.

################ Title:

As Covid-19 relief program runs out of money, Democrats blame ‘KILLING’ of small businesses on Mnuchin – and fill up on ice cream

################ Subtitle:

################ Text:

<p>
The Paycheck Protection Program intended to help small businesses bridge coronavirus lockdowns has run out of funds. Democrats, who opposed extending it, are now misquoting Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to blame him instead.
All $350 billion in the PPP was exhausted by Thursday, as over 1.6 million small businesses sought funds to keep running through the coronavirus lockdowns. Some 22 million Americans have already lost their jobs due to what senior public health officials described as an “inconvenience” that has lasted over a month already.
</p>
<p>
Both President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) placed the blame squarely on the Democrats, who last week refused to vote for a “clean” bill that would add funding to the PPP. Trump urged the opposition party to “stop playing politics” and accused it of “killing American small businesses.”
</p>
<p>
The PPP was part of a $2 trillion stimulus package intended to help the economy through what was initially supposed to be a two-week shutdown to stop the spread of the virus – which has since turned into a month, with some states wishing to extend it indefinitely. The relief was arguably already too little, too late by the time it was passed, having been delayed by over a week due to demands from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California).
</p>
<p>
In order to get it passed as quickly as possible, the White House basically sidelined the congressional Republicans and delegated Mnuchin to negotiate directly with Pelosi, agreeing to some notorious pork-barrel projects such as $25 million for the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC – which ended up firing their staff anyway.
</p>
<p>
So it is doubly ironic that Mnuchin found himself the designated villain on Thursday, as Democrat activists accused him of saying that Americans are supposed to make the $1,200 cash payment from the government stretch for 10 weeks.
</p>
<blockquote>

</p>
<p>
Steve Mnuchin thinks Americans can live on $1,200 for 10 weeks.
</p>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Arizona Democrat Brianna Westbrook’s video of Mnuchin’s CBS appearance went viral. Within hours, Mnuchin’s name was being cursed by a chorus ranging from #Resistance activists and earnest Bernie Sanders followers, to mainstream media journalists and disgraced former members of Congress.
</p>
<p>
The trouble with it is that Mnuchin was not speaking about the $1,200 checks. His full quote, which sites like Raw Story dutifully cited – and then used a misleading clickbait headline to misinterpret it – literally refers to the entire $2 trillion CARES Act:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I think the entire package provides economic relief overall for about 10 weeks.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The noise about the Treasury secretary conveniently drowned out any mention of Pelosi herself, who did her best Marie Antoinette impression by posting a video about enjoying a walk-in freezer filled with ice cream.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Nancy Pelosi

@SpeakerPelosi
</p>
<p>
We all have found our ways to keep our spirits up during these trying times. Mine just happens to fill up my freezer. #LateLateShow
</p>
<p>
Embedded video
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
While the US healthcare system has not been overwhelmed by Covid-19 patients and the alarmist models used to justify the lockdowns were off by orders of magnitude, the virus has infected over 641,000 Americans and killed 31,590, according to official data as of Thursday.

Politico Edits False Story Claiming Trump Owes Millions to China

################ Subtitle:

Politico edited on Saturday morning a story claiming Donald Trump owes millions to the Bank of China for a loan on a New York City office building, hours after Breitbart News exposed the story as false.

################ Text:

<p>
The story now begins with a note that it has been “updated to include comment from the Bank of China and additional reporting.” Despite the initial story being substantively incorrect and getting several details wrong, Politico did not issue a formal correction, as standard journalistic good practice would indicate they should. What’s more, the story continues to be wrong in several places.
</p>
<p>
The original story’s headline was “Trump owes tens of millions to Bank of China.” Now it is “Trump owed tens of millions to Bank of China.” But that claim is still wrong. Trump never owed tens of millions to Bank of China, as Breitbart News reported Friday.  The subhead is” The president’s financial dealings with the state-owned bank complicate his attacks on Biden,” another false claim that remains in the story.
</p>
<p>
The Washington, DC, based media company falsely reported Friday that Trump owes millions to the Bank of China for a loan financing a building located at 1290 Avenue of the Americas. The story said that the president would have to pay tens of millions of dollars to the state-controlled banks because the loan was coming due shortly, a situation which it described as “unprecedented.”
</p>
<p>
Breitbart News reported Friday that the story was wrong. President Trump is not the debtor and Bank of China is not the creditor on the loan to 1290 Avenue of the Americas. Trump is the minority partner in a real estate deal that owns the building, had nothing to do with arranging the loans, and is not liable for their repayment. Bank of China was one of a consortium of lenders in 2012 that provided $950 million but sold its interest days later when the loan was repackaged into bonds for investors.
</p>
<p>
Politico now reports:
</p>
<p>
After the first version of this article was published, the Bank of China issued a statement Friday evening stating that it sold its debt on the building weeks after the 2012 loan on the property. Vornado Realty Trust owns 70 percent of the building.
</p>
<p>
“On November 7, 2012 several financial institutions including the Bank of China participated in a commercial mortgage loan of $950 million to Vornado Realty Trust,” said Peter Reisman, managing director and chief communications officer of Bank of China U.S.A. “Within 22 days, the loan was securitized and sold into the [commercial mortgage-backed securities] market, as is a common practice in the industry. Bank of China has not had any ownership interest in that loan since late November 2012.”
</p>
<p>
The story also said that Trump’s “financial dealings” with the Chinese bank undermined his campaign’s efforts to highlight that the election of Joe Biden “would be a gift to the Communist country and America’s chief economic rival.” The Biden campaign and its mainstream media allies have been pushing back against this by claiming that Trump has lately been “coddling China,” despite the fact that the Trump administration still has tariffs in place on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods.
</p>
<p>
That part has not yet been corrected, although it too is false. “The president’s financial dealings with the state-owned bank complicate his attacks on Biden,” the story still says. But Trump did not have financial dealings with the state-owned bank. He was a passive holder of limited parternship shares in a real estate trust managed by Vornado Realty, one of the biggest commercial real estate investors in the U.S.
</p>
<p>
The headline on the story claimes “Trump owed tens of millions to Bank of China.” That is also false. Trump never owed money to China, the Vornado controlled trust did. And China’s interest in the loans was extinguished in a matter of days, eight years ago.
</p>
<p>
The story also fails to convey the critical fact that Bank of China is one of the largest foreign investors in commercial real estate in the U.S., making its participation in the financing of 1290 Avenue of the Americas far from unusual. The deal was the first time a loan with a Chinese lender participating was securitized, meaning packaged into a mortgage-backed security and sold to investors.
</p>
<p>
More corrections are needed.
